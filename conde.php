			<p>Meg has worked with the technology team at Condé Nast for the past two years hashing out this extremely complex system. Copilot allows Condé Nast Traveler employees to input online content with ease. Meg’s UI skills along with added support from Laura, Mike and Brad— this CMS is bangin’!</p>

			<h2>Laura and Meg put together a logo, mascot and iconography for the Copilot brand. Deloris, the loris Copilot mascot, is a cheery friend to the many content-type icons that Laura created.</h2>

			<h2>Many hefty rounds of user testing were done to work out the usability throughout Copilot’s UI. Meg has worked directly with the Technology team’s UX lead to launch and iterate on various versions of Copilot to make the product easy to use. We’re changing the lives of many a CNT employee, and it makes us happy.

			<img class="mocks" src="projects/Conde_Nast_Traveler/StyleGuide.jpg" alt="Copilot styleguide" />
			<h2>This UI has a thorough style guide that keeps the Condé Nast development team happy. The style guide allows them to run smoothly without having to constantly pester Meg and the rest of the Ghostly Ferns when something doesn’t quite look right. A quick glance at the style guide can clear up any confusion. Breathe easier, devs! We got you.</h2>
			<p>A huge, massive thanks to Ed, Jon, Christina, Laura and the rest of the Condé Nast team for their amazing collaboration on Copilot. It’s been a long road to get this product where it is today and we have plenty left to do! Condé Nast has been an incredible partner and we’ve loved every second of working with them on Copilot.</p>
