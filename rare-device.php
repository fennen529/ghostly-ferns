			<p>Meg teamed up with Giselle, the owner of Rare Device, to design a new brand identity and site redesign for this incredibly popular San Francisco shop. Bold contrast is boldly contrasted with clean design to create a darn good aesthetic that compliments the beautifully designed items this shop sells.</p>

			<h2>Meg worked tirelessly (with plenty of naps) to create a highly clean design that packs a ton of personality. The geometric-based brand identity packs a punch alongside the whitespace-tastic site design.</h2>

			<p>We're all huge fans of Rare Device and are so thrilled with the final product. Many thanks Giselle and Rare Device for being so great to work with. Designed in part with the fine folks at Aeolidia.</p>
