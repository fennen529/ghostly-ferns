			<p>Jen was called in by the amazingly talented advertising team at Logan NY to collaborate on some frames for Lincoln Motor Company's latest heritage spot. Being a classic yet artful brand, Lincoln sought the value in hand lettering and the kind of obsessive craftsmanship that Jen puts into her work.</p>
			<p>This campaign, titled "Hello Again," served as a re-introduction for Lincoln as a brand whose style was never compromised over its long history. Created out of Henry Ford's everyman-popular Ford Motor Company by Edsel Ford, Lincoln always sought to make something beautiful for consumers. This is still present in both their automobile design but also in their advertising campaigns, which often include artist-made installations and very experimental work.</p>
			<p>Jen worked in-house for three weeks at the gorgeous Logan NY SoHo office where she collaborated with graphic designers, motion artists, lighting artists, and animators to create the unique layered effects that make this commercial so distinct.  Art Director Kenji Yamashita lent his expertly trained eye and worked very closely in guiding the hundreds of drawings that Jen created in the process.</p>
			<p>This spot aired during the 2014 Grammy Awards and was seen by 28.5 million people.</p>
