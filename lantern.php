			<p>Lantern is a startup working on improving online therapy with programs for anxiety, stress, body image and more. Not only do they have amazing lessons and content that help and educate users, but they also pair users with a therapist who they can contact for additional help and guidance when required. Illustrations are used heavily throughout the programs, which is where Laura came in. Laura has been working with Lantern for some time now, creating a whole range of spot illustrations and iconography to both support and bring their content to life, with a friendly and approachable tone. This is an ongoing project for Laura with a lot of illustration work ahead as Lantern keep building new programs and adding more content.</p>
