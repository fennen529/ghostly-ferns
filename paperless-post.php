			<p>Over the past two years Brad has worked on the team with Paperless Post. During this time he updated the look and feel of the desktop and mobile products. His first major projects were designing a new iPad app and completely updating the original iPhone app. In the last year the focus has shifted to overhauling the main site styles and building a comprehensive living style guide.</p>
