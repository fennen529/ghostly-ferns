			<h2>Some of our favorite customizable Picklejuice features are the animated item names on the product page and the cart overlay that (ever so gently) places itself on top of any page. Subtle transitions and mind-melding blurs make Picklejuice the frontrunner for queen at the Big Cartel Prom. (there is no Big Cartel Prom, we made that up)</h2>

			<h1>And, oh baby, Picklejuice looks every bit as gushy and gorgeous on a phone or tablet as it does on your desktop. Images and text automatically resize for any screen. Just like eating a pickle, the site gets smaller and smaller and smaller… until you ate all the website.</h1>
