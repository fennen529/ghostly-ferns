			<p>Meg and Brad worked with the mobile tech team at Condé Nast to come up with a concept pitch for a Vanity Fair Hollywood Digest. This app brings the latest articles to readers in need and on the go. It may still be “in-progress” but our love for this app is true.</p>

			<h2>We can’t say much about the usability or UI of this app, but we don’t want you to leave empty handed. We’re working with some extremely experimental UX patterns and a lot of user testing to make sure this app is destined for success. Huge thanks to the mobile team at Condé Nast for working out the dev kinks on this crazy product.</h2>
