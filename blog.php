				<p>Freelancing is hard work. That’s why at Ghostly Ferns we subscribe to a belief that freelancing is much better when surrounded by friends. Here at Ghostly Ferns, we each bring an awesome skill to the Ghostly Ferns table. When possible, we mix our skills into a giant skill salad and make badass projects together. We aren’t an average design studio, we aren’t exactly a collective. We’re doing something brand new and it’s awesome. We act as a support group and sounding board for one another on a daily basis. We’re here for each other and we are best friends. We care for each other and inspire each other. It rules. That’s why we’ve decided to debut this crazy new website full of obscurities and general wackiness. Because we can.</p>

				<p>We know what you’re thinking. It’s pretty ballsy to release a site that has a topless ghost mascot. “What will the clients think?” is a question we’re ready to address. Our answer, in short, is that we don’t want to work with anyone who would be turned off by an illustration of poo or a happy, au naturel ghost. Our goal is to exude our personalities in the Ghostly Ferns brand to the max in hopes to attract companies with like-minded missions.</p>

				<p>Our team loves to work for “happy companies”. Happy companies are those who are working toward creating delightful experiences for their users and are genuinely excited about making the world a better place. We work for companies that are excited about working with Ghostly Ferns and put their trust in us to create exciting, personable design and illustration.<br><br>Let’s introduce the Ghostly Ferns team!</p>

				<p>Jen is our beautiful Italian goddess. She is strong and fierce like none other and is a genuinely delightful conversationalist. She can talk to anyone about anything and still look 100% interested. When she isn’t waving at animals from afar, you can find her reading the internet. Jen still doesn’t have her drivers license.</p>

				<p>Brad is a silent deadly fox. He doesn’t speak unless he has something important to say, so listen up. He is incredibly passionate and loves all things living. Brad is the most loyal person we know. Brad’s signature dance move is a gentle sway of the hips.</p>

				<p>Mike is our #2 most beautiful Italian goddess (well man goddess). He has received over 5 gold medals for his laugh. Mike gives amazing hugs and almost always spells everything wrong. He is genuine and sincere. When not being compared to Jake Gyllenhaal, you can find Mike moving his eyebrows all around his face. They’re magic.</p>

				<img src="posts/2-25-15/CrazyMeg.jpg" alt="Meg" />
				<p>Meg is the O.G. Ghostly Fern. Actually the most positive person on the planet, you will rarely hear her complain or say "no." She has the tendency to be down for anything, which of course leads to great adventure.  Thinking about Santa and/or mimes makes her cry.</p>

				<img src="posts/2-25-15/CrazyLaura.jpg" alt="Laura" />
				<p>Laura is our sunshiny ray of kindness. She loves and inspires our team to the max and makes a mean cuppa Yorkshire tea. If anyone crosses a Ghostly Fern, Laura goes into full mother wolf mode to protect her pack. Laura is happiest when she is upside down. Like a bat.</p>
