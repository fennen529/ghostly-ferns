			<p>Placemeter is an app that leverages computer vision to capture real time data about the physical world and turns it into a simplistic consumer experience for all.</p>

			<p>Meg worked with Florent &amp; Jason at Placemeter to design an iOS answer to a very simple question: how busy are the places around me? The result is a highly usable app that answers all of your questions about a space and turns it into colorful, clean data.</p>

			<h2>iOS designs for the Placemeter app included a lot of hefty UX work and plenty of "back to the drawing board" moments. Designing for such a robust app is a challenge that Meg was happy to meet. She led the design on this app and played an important role in UX decisions and strategy. This consumer app may be coming soon, but Placemeter is up to some crazy stuff.</h2>
